In the realm of torrenting, your "ratio" is a badge of honour. If you take more than you give, you're not just seen as inconsiderate â€” your behaviour undermines the foundation that the community is built upon.

Try applying this mindset to other areas of your life. Focus on uploading more and downloading less. By applying this mindset in other areas of your life, you'll become happier, healthier, harder, faster, better, stronger.
