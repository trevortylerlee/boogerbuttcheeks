## 1. Raycast

[Raycast](https://www.raycast.com/) is like a GUI terminal. It has features baked in that [Sherlock](https://512pixels.net/2013/12/the-brushed-metal-diaries-sherlock/) other apps on the platform. The free version of Raycast includes functions like:

- an app launcher
- a clipboard manager
- a colour picker
- an emoji picker
- a file searcher
- an uninstaller
- a natural language calculator
- a currency converter
- a window manager
- an app switcher
- a script runner

and much more. Those are all native, baked in features. There's a robust and active extension store filled with integrations with your favourite apps and additional utilities. You can control apps like Spotify, Notion, and Homebrew all in Raycast.

Raycast has a premium subscription plan where users get access to colour themes, improved AI integration, and more. It starts at $8USD/month. They also have a pricing plan for enterprise customers. I use the free version.

Raycast is a VC funded company.

**Alternatives**: [Quicksilver](https://qsapp.com/index.php), [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/) (free with one time $45USD purchase option), [Monarch](https://www.monarchlauncher.com/) (one time purchase while in beta)

## 2. Visual Studio Code

Check out my [config files](/blog/1-vscode-config).

[VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is developed by Microsoft. It's [free](https://code.visualstudio.com/download), [popular](https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2023/#section-most-popular-technologies-integrated-development-environment), [open source](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode), [configurable](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/settings), [extensible](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/vscode), and perfect for the [average pleb](https://www.trevortylerlee.com/).

**Alternatives**: [Neovim](https://neovim.io/), [Doom Emacs](https://github.com/doomemacs/doomemacs), [WebStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/) and [Fleet](https://www.jetbrains.com/fleet/)(subscription), [Nova](https://nova.app/) (subscription)

## 3. Chrome

[Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-CA/firefox/new/) is a fantastic browser that works on nearly all the sites [Chrome](https://www.google.com/intl/en_ca/chrome/) does. I enjoy using Firefox and recommend it to others.

Unfortunately I always end up stumbling on to some government or bank website that doesn't work on Firefox. That reason alone is why I can't pick Firefox, as much as I'd like to.

[Chrome's dominance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usage_share_of_web_browsers) and [recent changes on ad blocking](https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/08/chromes-manifest-v3-and-its-changes-for-ad-blocking-are-coming-real-soon/) are concerning.

**Alternatives**: [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-CA/firefox/new/), [Safari](https://www.apple.com/ca/safari/), [Ladybird](https://ladybird.org/), [Brave](https://brave.com/), [Opera](https://www.opera.com/), [Arc](https://arc.net/), [Orion](https://kagi.com/orion/) (paid)

## 4. WezTerm

Switched from [iTerm2](https://iterm2.com/). I like that [WezTerm's](https://wezfurlong.org/wezterm/index.html) configuration is done through a file and not a GUI like iTerm2. The docs are great and it's made by a single dude, Wez Furlong. It's minimal and seems about on par with Alacritty or [Kitty](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/) in terms of speed (which means it's fast!).

**Alternatives**: [iTerm2](https://iterm2.com/index.html), [Kitty](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/), [Alacritty](https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty), Terminal (Apple), [Warp](https://www.warp.dev/) (subscription)

## 5. BitWarden

Are password managers similar to putting all your eggs in one basket? After what happened at [LastPass](https://blog.lastpass.com/posts/2022/12/notice-of-security-incident), are they even offer an advantage over keeping track of your passwords yourself?

I use [BitWarden](https://bitwarden.com/) because:

- I only have to remember my master password
- If my accounts get hacked I'll have someone to blame other than myself
- It's [free](https://bitwarden.com/) and [open source](https://github.com/bitwarden)

It includes a password generator that I like because you can set it to generate pass phrases, which are human-friendly. You organize your saved logins into folders, and there's an option to favourite a login if you use it frequently. There's also a [native iOS version](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitwarden/comments/1b32bbz/going_native_the_future_of_the_bitwarden_mobile/) in development!

In my experience it's somewhat unreliable at automatically saving your logins. I enter mine manually which is more tedious. The experience is more hands on but offers greater control and flexibility when compared to something like Apple's Keychain. And unlike Keychain, it's available on any platform you can think of.

**Alternatives**: Keychain (Apple), [1Password](https://1password.com/) (subscription), [Proton Pass](https://proton.me/pass) (subscription)
