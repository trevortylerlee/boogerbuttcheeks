## 1. Raycast

[Raycast](https://www.raycast.com/) is the app that's had the largest impact on my performance. Its design is inspired by CLIs, and I've described it as a GUI terminal. It has so many features baked in that it [Sherlocks](https://512pixels.net/2013/12/the-brushed-metal-diaries-sherlock/) other apps on the platform. The free version of Raycast includes functions like:

- an app launcher
- a clipboard manager
- a color picker
- an emoji picker
- a file searcher
- an uninstaller
- a natural language calculator
- a currency converter
- a window manager
- an app switcher
- a script runner

and much more. Those are all native, baked in features. There's also a robust and active extension store filled with integrations with your favorite apps and additional utilities. You can control apps like Spotify, Notion, and Homebrew all in Raycast.

I use the free version — Raycast has a premium subscription plan where users get access to color themes, improved AI integration, and more. It starts at $8USD/month. They also have a pricing plan for enterprise customers.

Raycast is apparently a VC funded company, so keep that in mind.

**Alternatives**: [Quicksilver](https://qsapp.com/index.php), [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/) (free with one time $45USD purchase option), [Monarch](https://www.monarchlauncher.com/) (one time purchase while in beta)

## 2. Visual Studio Code

[It's free](https://code.visualstudio.com/), it's almost a standard, and I'm not good enough to use [Neovim](https://neovim.io/). I'm pretty happy with [my config](/blog/1-vscode-config) right now!

**Alternatives**: [Neovim](https://neovim.io/), [Doom Emacs](https://github.com/doomemacs/doomemacs), [WebStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/) and [Fleet](https://www.jetbrains.com/fleet/)(subscription), [Nova](https://nova.app/) (subscription)

## 3. Chrome

It's true that [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-CA/firefox/new/) works on 98% of the sites that work on [Chrome](https://www.google.com/intl/en_ca/chrome/). I like Firefox and I encourage people around me to make the switch. Chrome is also slowly killing uBlock Origin.

It seems like the 2% of sites that aren't Firefox friendly is 100× more likely to be some government or bank site that controls a significant factor to my life. The last thing I want to do is log in to CRA and have it scream at me to use Chrome.

**Alternatives**: [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-CA/firefox/new/), [Safari](https://www.apple.com/ca/safari/), [Ladybird](https://ladybird.org/), [Brave](https://brave.com/), [Opera](https://www.opera.com/), [Arc](https://arc.net/), [Orion](https://kagi.com/orion/) (paid)

## 4. WezTerm

Switched from [iTerm2](https://iterm2.com/). I like that [WezTerm's](https://wezfurlong.org/wezterm/index.html) configuration is done through a file and not a GUI like iTerm2. The docs are great and it's made by a single dude, Wez Furlong. It's minimal and seems about on par with Alacritty or [Kitty](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/) in terms of speed (which means it's fast!).

**Alternatives**: [iTerm2](https://iterm2.com/index.html), [Kitty](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/), [Alacritty](https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty), Terminal (Apple), [Warp](https://www.warp.dev/) (subscription)

## 5. BitWarden

Are password managers similar to putting all your eggs in one basket? After what happened at [LastPass](https://blog.lastpass.com/posts/2022/12/notice-of-security-incident), are they even offer an advantage over keeping track of your passwords yourself? All good questions.

I use [BitWarden](https://bitwarden.com/) because:

- I only have to remember my master password
- If my accounts get hacked I'll have someone to blame other than myself
- It's free and open source

It includes a password generator that I like because you can set it to generate passphrases, which are human-friendly. You organize your saved logins into folders, and there's an option to favourite a login if you use it frequently. There's also a [native iOS version](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitwarden/comments/1b32bbz/going_native_the_future_of_the_bitwarden_mobile/) in development!

I've found it to be somewhat unreliable at automatically saving your logins, so I enter mine manually which is a bit more tedious. Overall, the experience is more hands-on but offers greater control and flexibility when compared to something like Apple's Keychain. And also unlike Keychain, it's available on pretty much any platform you can think of.

**Alternatives**: Keychain (Apple), [1Password](https://1password.com/) (subscription), [Proton Pass](https://proton.me/pass) (subscription)
