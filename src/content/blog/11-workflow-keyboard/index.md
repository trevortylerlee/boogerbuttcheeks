I highly recommend picking up a keyboard that is VIA/QMK compatible. It allows you to use free, open source software to remap your keyboard to your heart's content. The rest of the details (apart from layout) like keycaps, switches, and being hotswappable won't impact your productivity significantly.

For the hobbyists, I use a KBD67 lite (Model KBD67MKIIRGBV3) keyboard. It's a 65% keyboard layout that's hotswappable and comes with USB C. I have GMK CYL Dots 2 Light keycaps, which I enjoy because they're legendless. This means I'm free to experiment with swapping around keys in software and don't have to worry about the physical keycaps not matching. I use HMX Hyacinth linear switches on my stabilized keys and Cherry Browns everywhere else.

As for my VIA configuration, I have 3 layers.

**Layer 1**
- <kbd>Caps Lock</kbd> now acts as <kbd>Escape</kbd> when tapped and <kbd>Control</kbd> when held. Here's how you [set up this behaviour with VIA](/10-mod-tap-with-via).
- <kbd>\ |</kbd> acts as <kbd>` ~</kbd>.
