Have you checked out my [brain dump](/brain-dump)? It's just an embedded Figma widget. If you want to make your own, I created a [super simple one page template](https://github.com/trevortylerlee/figma-embed-template/) for you to use.

1. Scrapbook with Figma
2. Clone the repository
3. Add your information to `src/siteConfig.ts`
4. Push to GitHub/Gitlab
5. Deploy with Cloudflare/Netlify/Vercel
6. Profit!

While Canva offers a convenient "whiteboard" feature that publishes a website, I prefer using Figma for digital scrapbooking. Here's why:

## Cost and Ownership

Diversifying your digital toolbelt is important and relying too heavily on a single platform like Canva can be risky. Features and services may change their terms or become paywalled without warning.

My implementation uses technologies that each have multiple alternatives:

- Version control: GitHub, GitLab
- Framework: Astro, HTMX, Svelte
- Hosting platform: Cloudflare Pages, GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel, AWS

## Figma > Canva

I have free accounts on both platforms and Canva is a lot more pushy about getting you to subscribe to Canva Pro. I also prefer Figma's embedded iframe behaviour. While the Canva widget shows a static, scaled version of your canvas, Figma's widget is fully interactive. You can zoom and pan around the infinite canvas on both desktop and mobile.

## The Joy of Digital Scrapbooking

It's fun to build your own little website and your own digital scrapbook. It's reminds me of the days I spent tinkering and tweaking themes on tumblr. A website is a wonderful medium to introduce yourself to the world, showcase your interests, and document your journey. It's a digital canvas where you can experiment, learn, and grow.
